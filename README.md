### decription
  
To run this repo:

1, python data_detect_generator.py 0     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     # to generate validation images for detection
  
2, python data_detect_generator.py 1     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    # to generate training images for detection
  
3, python data_rects_extrator.py 0     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     # to generate validation data-rects for recognition
  
4, python data_rects_extrator.py 1     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    # to generate training data
  
5, python script_recog.py      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     # to train and validate
  
  
  

By 1 and 2, images with texts will be generated with images in images_base as background. The images will be saved in a newly-maked folders: ./data_train and ./data_valid.

By 3 and 4, text-rects will be extracted from images generated by 1 and 2. The rect images and texts will be saved in a newly-maked folders: ./data_rects_train and ./data_rects_valid.

By 5, the model will be trained and validated. The ckpt files will be stored in a newly-maked directory, ./model_recog.
  


### reference

The model is mainly based on the method described in the article:
